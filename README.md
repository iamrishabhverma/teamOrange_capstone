# Capstone Project : G1 ExpertRules

Hey there Folks!

This is our Capstone Project in which we are simulating a learning app which can help all the beginners out there who are struggling to get on roads for driving their own cars. This application can help them to achieve the very essential knowledge to clear the first and most significant hurdle to be eligible to drive their own vehicle on roads on Ontario,Canada. 


We (Rishabh Verma, Simranjeet Kaur, Kirandeep Kaur and Avinash Sharma) have included the following functionalities for the app:

1). Localization - The user is independent to use this app in the three most popular languages of Canada , that are : English , French and Punjabi. Learning any new thing in our language makes the grasping more effective and efficient.

2). Storing the Data to Cloud platform - We have tried to implement cloud storage using Firebase. All the questions are been fetched from the cloud storage in the form of JSON file. 

Note : JSON file for the questions is provided in the 46th Commit.

3). Dark and Light Mode - We have made this to be capable of switching the graphics from Night to Light Mode.This could make the user experience even better and give the user interactivity.
